2. The toolkit is dedicated to the AVR processor.
3. The toolkit has been developed by using the Atmel Studio V6.
4. Atmel Studio V6 is also used in the development of apps.
5. This is not for kids who do not want to know the programming details.
6. This is for programmers who want to learn how to write programs for iot.
